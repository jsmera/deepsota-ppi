# Reconstruction of protein-protein interactions based on amino acid chain decomposition

---

This repository contains the implementation of the thesis work *Reconstruction of protein-protein interactions based on amino acid chain decomposition*. The model is located in the `pre-trained` folder with file extension `h5`. The `main.ipynb` file contains the workflow that led to the model, it is recommended to open it in Google Colab.

If you want to run the original parameterization, create the following folder `tunner/DeepMAS-PPI` in the root of the project and download the following files (here)[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/100KwCHDHNu7VHtmi1_JdMVnJ6RBEZZTD?usp=sharing]
